# CryoBoltz ❄️ ⚡

[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04490)] [[Website](https://cryoboltz.cs.princeton.edu/)]

CryoBoltz is a method for fitting atomic structures into cryo-EM density maps of dynamic proteins. It is built on top of Boltz-1, a state-of-the-art structure prediction model for biomolecular complexes. Through a multi-stage guidance mechanism that modifies the Boltz diffusion trajectory at inference time, CryoBoltz recovers diverse conformations from input cryo-EM data.

## Run in Google Colab
Don't want to install anything? [`notebooks/CryoBoltz_Colab.ipynb`](notebooks/CryoBoltz_Colab.ipynb) runs the whole pipeline on a free Colab GPU: installation, model weights, input preparation and validation, map cropping, guided prediction, and 3D visualization of the model in the map. It also includes a small built-in smoke test (synthetic map, ~10 min on a T4) and can build the required pre-aligned structure for you — an unguided Boltz prediction plus a rigid-body fit into the map — so ChimeraX is not needed. Open it with [Colab's GitHub loader](https://colab.research.google.com/github/) or via the *Open in Colab* link on the file's GitHub page.

Note that the Pma1 example below is a 918-residue system and needs an A100/L4-class GPU; smaller systems fit on a free T4.

## Installation
We recommend installing CryoBoltz in a clean conda environment -- first clone the git repository, and then use `pip` to install the package from the source code:
```
conda create --name cryoboltz python=3.10
conda activate cryoboltz
git clone https://github.com/ml-struct-bio/cryoboltz.git
cd cryoboltz
pip install -e .
```
Run the following to check that the installation was successful:
```
boltz predict --help
```

## Prepare Inputs

CryoBoltz requires the following inputs:

1. The sequence to be modeled, in FASTA or YAML format. See the Boltz [prediction instructions](https://github.com/ml-struct-bio/cryoboltz/blob/main/docs/prediction.md) for more details.

2. A cryo-EM density map, in MRC format. The prediction may be sped up by cropping background regions of the map first -- see the Example section below. It is also recommended to have an estimated map resolution, and choose a map threshold that excludes background noise.

3. An existing structure that is roughly aligned with the map, in CIF format. This structure aids in pre-aligning the CryoBoltz prediction to the map during the diffusion sampling process, but is not otherwise used as a template. This may be, e.g., an unguided Boltz prediction aligned to the map, or a partially built model from [ModelAngelo](https://github.com/3dem/model-angelo). Please ensure that the chain labels in the input structure match those of the sequence file.


## Run Prediction

Once the inputs have been prepared, prediction can be run with a single command:
```
boltz predict <SEQ_PATH> --density_map <MRC_PATH> --aligned_model <CIF_PATH> --res <RESOLUTION> --thresh <THRESHOLD> --use_msa_server --out_dir results
```
Below are the available arguments specific to CryoBoltz. For a full list of options of the base Boltz model, see its [prediction instructions](https://github.com/ml-struct-bio/cryoboltz/blob/main/docs/prediction.md).

## Example

Here we walk through the modeling of a Pma1 monomer in its autoinhibited state ([PDB:9UGC](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/9UGC)).

### Preparing the sequence
Download the FASTA file from [PDB:9UGC](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/9UGC). Following the Boltz formatting convention, and restricting ourselves to a single monomer, we rewrite the header. The file (*rcsb_pdb_9UGC.fasta*) should looks as follows:
```
>A|protein
MTDTSSSSSS...
```

### Preparing the map
Download and decompress the map file from [EMDB:64136](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-64136). We note that the reported resolution is **3.52 Å**. Furthermore, by visual inspection (e.g. in [ChimeraX](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/)), we choose **0.35** as the map threshold. The prediction can be sped up by cropping out background regions of the map. Here, we crop to the density at the 0.35 threshold with 10 voxels of padding on each side:
```
python scripts/preproc_map.py emd_64136.map --thresh 0.35 --pad 10 -o map_cropped.mrc
```
Alternatively, the `--dim` option can be used to crop the map to a fixed size.

### Preparing the input structure
For the input structure, we will use an unguided Boltz prediction that has been aligned to the map. We have provided such a structure in *examples/input_struct.cif*. To create your own, run Boltz without cryo-EM inputs:
```
boltz predict rcsb_pdb_9UGC.fasta --diffusion_samples 1 --use_msa_server --out_dir unguided_results
```
Then align the prediction (*unguided_results/boltz_results_rcsb_pdb_9UGC/predictions/rcsb_pdb_9UGC/rcsb_pdb_9UGC_model_0.cif*) to the map, e.g. using the `fitmap` function in [ChimeraX](https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/).

### Running the prediction
With the inputs ready, we can now run Boltz with map guidance:
```
boltz predict rcsb_pdb_9UGC.fasta --diffusion_samples 5 --use_msa_server --density_map map_cropped.mrc --aligned_model examples/input_struct.cif --res 3.52 --thresh 0.35 --out_dir cryoboltz_results
```
The predicted structures are ordered by decreasing confidence score. We suggest visually assessing the fit of each candidate structure to the map. To select candidates based on measures of map-model fit, we refer to the tools available in [Phenix](https://phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/validation_cryo_em.html) and other validation packages.

<!-- ### Ranking the output structures
By default, the predicted structures are ordered by decreasing confidence score. We suggest visually assessing the fit of each candidate structure to the map. We also provide a script for ranking the structures by map-model fit. It computes the real space correlation coefficient (RSCC) using a simple forward measurement model. For more comprehensive fit metrics, we refer to the tools available in [Phenix](https://phenix-online.org/documentation/reference/validation_cryo_em.html).
```
python scripts/rank.py cryoboltz_results
```
This generates a CSV file in the same directory as the output CIF files. -->
